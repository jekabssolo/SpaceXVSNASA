# SpaceX VS NASA
### A JS and Python web app
My web app SpaceX VS NASA serves the purpose to compare two distinctly different space exploration agencies â€“ NASA and SpaceX. 
NASA is a very old federal government agency while SpaceX is considerably newer private company, but which one is performing better? 
In my app you can compare rocket launches of both agencies in each year since the first launch of SpaceX in 2006 as well as location of all launching platforms and pads of both companies, where the rockets have been launched.
